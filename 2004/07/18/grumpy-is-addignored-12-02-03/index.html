	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The vast architectural empire was getting Grumpy down, with all the restocking and price check tells, so Grumpy decided to take the night off and hide on his stealth alt. Sometimes Grumpy answers architectural type questions while on his alt, and then he&#8217;ll look around the area to see if anyone found it odd that a &#8220;Novice Scout&#8221; knows so much about architecture; but in these days of holocron madness, he doubts he needs to worry about that anymore.</p>
<p>His alt isn&#8217;t really anything yet and probably never will be. His alt is a Novice Artisan, Brawler, Scout, Marksman AND Medic. The alt used to be Novice Entertainer too, but then Grumpy decided there was no way in h*ll he&#8217;d ever be a Master entertainer-anything, so he dropped that.</p>
<p>Grumpy figured that night he would have a few refreshments and heal the dancers in the Cantina to work on his medic skills. The alt&#8217;s pet has an annoying habit of running headlong into a pack of very red and angry mobs in an attempt to reverse-zerg the camp. Accordingly, Grumpy spends a lot of time healing up his pet. As in, MOST of the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes his pet will run off to find red and angry mobs and bring them back to Grumpy! Grumpy usually runs away, maybe even a burstrun for good measure, but his pet always finds him and brings the unwelcome red mobs along. Then it&#8217;s clone time. Grumpy will keep his thoughts on item decay to himself&#8230;for now.</p>
<p>Grumpy wanted a lot of flourishing dancers so the medic experience would fly by and he would be Master Medic in about 15 minutes. Everybody knows that Coronet always has 38029 dancers on duty, with only about 38012 of them afk, so he set up in Coronet with a huge stack of stimpack crates (all varieties of stims too because this was only gonna take about 15, 30 minutes tops.)</p>
<p>He set up by one of the higher-level dancers. Grumpy knows they&#8217;re a higher-level because they do the &#8220;Come Over and Have Sex with Me&#8221; dance. Grumpy bypassed anyone that was a Man doing the Sex dance, that was just disturbing. His gf/business partner thought that was disturbing too, so he doubts that its homophobia. (This time.) He also bypassed anyone jumping around like a bunny or twirling like a ballerina on crack.</p>
<p>He watched the dancer&#8217;s action bar and when it dropped a bit, BOO YA!!, incoming stimpack heal! It was a good one too, 80 whole points of healing goodness!! He shouted to his gf that he just got off a 80 point heal; she shouted back cool. Grumpy is no stranger to patronization and figured he&#8217;d keep his successes to himself.</p>
<p>H o w e v e r, Grumpy had apparently broken Cantina etiquette by healing&#8211;without asking first if she was already some other medic&#8217;s dancer. !!!! This punk medic started unloading on Grumpy about rude this and that and some other BS. He was getting so upset he had a vein bulging on his Master Image-Designed face. No worries, Grumpy would go find another dancer without a Medic partner.</p>
<p>A new dancer arrived in the Cantina and asked to be invited to the entertainer group. And asked. And asked. And asked. Finally, Grumpy said&#8230;For crissakes, someone invite the new dancer into the gd entertainer group. Silence. Well, not complete silence. There were a few&#8230;Soandso greets everyone. and Soandso says &#8220;Welcome to the cantina, relax and enjoy teh show&#8221; (misspellings and all&#8230;very professional). Emotes and welcomes issued at regularly-scheduled macro intervals, of course.</p>
<p>Grumpy had no time to help the new dancer anymore, he had just leveled in medic skills!! Grumpy asked in group talk if the other medic (not the punk medic, Grumpy knew he&#8217;d get no aid from him at this point) would train him in First Aid. No answer. Grumpy tried again. Grumpy thought it was possible the noob didn&#8217;t know how to send group talk to his default chat window, so asked in /say and /tell. Hmmmm. Maybe AFK. But no! The medic was talking to other people in /says, mostly the dancers, blowing kisses and professing love and that shiz. It was obvious that Grumpy had been addignored.</p>
<p>Grumpy&#8217;s been addignored before, he figures, but he hadn&#8217;t even done anything this time!! This noob had pre-emptively addignored Grumpy&#8217;s alt on what must have been a whim! So Grumpy said, would someone tell NoobMedic to take Grumpy off addignore for a minute please? And Grumpy saw that two of the dancers did in fact /say NoobMedic, take Grumpy off addignore for a minute. Still, nothing. </p>
<p>NoobMedic was apparently one of those internet psychos that Grumpy had heard so much about. Just in case NoobMedic didn&#8217;t really have Grumpy on addignore and was just being an asshat, Grumpy suggested that NoobMedic might want to have his meds adjusted to help with that psychosis that he found so troubling lately. A few of the dancers lol&#8217;d that (or issued regularly-scheduled macro lol&#8217;s, Grumpy&#8217;s not sure), but NoobMedic didn&#8217;t react, just continued growling at the dancers, groveling, blowing bubbles (woops, he must have screwed up his targeting that time) and arching his back seductively (disturbing).</p>
<p>Grumpy&#8217;s alt got trained by a Master Doctor near the starport and is more medically skilled now, but he will never understand why NoobMedic chose to addignore him at the Coronet cantina that day. Grumpy thinks the noob should keep Grumpy on the Ignore List too. </p>
<p>The next time Grumpy runs into NoobMedic, he&#8217;s gonna give NoobMedic plenty of reasons to ignore him.</p>
