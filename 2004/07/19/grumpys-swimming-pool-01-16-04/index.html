		<p>Grumpy&#8217;s all about community service. Not really, but he&#8217;s hoping if he disguises some of this as a Community Service, he can improve his own gaming life by not having to deal with some of this crap. Because really, Grumpy is all about Grumpy.</p>
<p><em>Auctions</em></p>
<p>Grumpy has always hated auctions in this game. Far too easy to manipulate, in his opinion. Some people might think that the auctioneers are simply confused on the proper terms to use &#8212; Grumpy thinks they know very well the proper terms.</p>
<p>Grumpy considered writing out some of the most commonly-used auction terms and etiquette for bidding and conducting an auction, then he realized that the asshats will continue to cheat and manipulate when it suits them and the honest people will continue to get taken. He, himself, never does auctions for this very reason, but if the rest of you like auctions, have at it.</p>
<p>He will say this tho: It&#8217;s not too much to ask that auctioneers clearly state the terms and their intentions and that they also insist ALL BIDDERS (in-game and out) post bids (either personally or through an agent) on the board for all board auctions. A final post on the thread from the auctioneer clearly outlining the final resolution of the sale would be nice, but is probably too much to ask of yo yo dawgs.</p>
<p>For you noobs out there&#8230;auctions with unstated reserves, blind buyouts/bidders is just another way of saying..Hi, I&#8217;m going to steal from you, happy bidding! </p>
<p><em>Pissing in Someone&#8217;s Swimming Pool</em></p>
<p>Grumpy has seen quite a few examples of this lately, in game and out. Marketing your own crap, in whatever way you want, is fine. But when you start banging on someone else&#8217;s business, you&#8217;re pissing in their pool and be forewarned, you may have your kneecaps taken out.</p>
<p>Example 1: Guy is hustling his stuff at a starport, you show up and tell all within earshot that his prices are wrong, too high, unreasonable, whatever. You just pissed in his pool, you messed with his business.</p>
<p>Example 2: You hustle your stuff at a starport by telling all within earshot that your prices are better, lower, more reasonable than Soandso&#8217;s. You just pissed in Soandso&#8217;s pool, you messed with his business.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get Grumpy wrong, you&#8217;re allowed to do pretty much whatever you please when hustling your crap. That&#8217;s called a free market. But watch your kneecaps. You see, when you make it known that you have no affinity with good manners and polite, friendly competition, Grumpy decides he doesn&#8217;t either.</p>
<p>Few months ago, someone pissed in Grumpy&#8217;s pool. It happens every so often, but this noob kept trying to walk with no kneecaps which is why Grumpy remembers him so vividly. The noob came to the message boards and talked sh*t about other architects&#8217; pricing and advertised his own pricing. (No, not that new marxist guy, this was another guy.) His pricing was very attractive. So attractive, in fact, that he made it worth Grumpy&#8217;s while to set up an army of alts near the vendor to check for fresh stock every day.</p>
<p>He would ban Grumpy, curse at Grumpy, rename his deeds to code names (Grumpy loved that one), but all was for naught, as Grumpy could easily get around all of those obstacles. The noob would sell out every day, and so would Grumpy, a few hours later.</p>
<p>Normally, Grumpy wouldn&#8217;t even notice someone else&#8217;s pricing, but the noob had pissed in Grumpy&#8217;s pool by talking sh*t, so Grumpy did what comes naturally to him. He made a tidy profit. H*ll, that profit was more than tidy, it was obscene. Hardcore.</p>
<p>So do what you want, most of us won&#8217;t even take note and life will go on happy happy joy joy as it always has. But piss in someone&#8217;s pool, watch those kneecaps.</p>
