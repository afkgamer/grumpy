	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week, after finishing the daily work of the vast Weaponsmith Empire, Grumpy and his gf/business partner switched over to their stealth alts and reviewed their hunting options for the evening. Grumpy suggested that since they now had a few more combat levels maybe they should try killing some fellow players again. (emphasis on TRY)</p>
<p>Grumpy was still smarting from getting a beat-down at the hands of a mostly-AFK Teras Kasi Master and, by God, he wanted some bragging rights. If killing some half-asleep entertainer in a cantina was his only option, THEN SO BE IT, the dancers and musicians would fall! But he sincerely hoped he wouldn&#8217;t have to resort to this. Just in case, he made sure to rationalize ahead of time by reminding his gf that War is All Hell, and there are no innocents!</p>
<p>They visited their favorite super secret NPC recruiter and swooped over to a nearby town, sure to be crawling with malcontents and vermin. Grumpy told his gf to store the bikes as they were either walking out of there later or cloning out. For crissakes, they couldn&#8217;t poke at the people then run to the bikes to escape.</p>
<p>There were quite a few red dots in town and his gf warned Grumpy not to pull too many of them at once. !!! How in the world Grumpy was going to avoid that, he didn&#8217;t know. These were PEOPLE, not stupid mobs that stand there chatting and gesturing while their comrade is slain at their feet. Although, in hindsight, that&#8217;s kind of what the people did. Just like stupid mobs.</p>
<p>Grumpy got the attention of two malcontents, NOT ENTERTAINERS, who tried to blow Grumpy&#8217;s head off with their rifles. Grumpy ducked behind a wall and anxiously awaited their arrival&#8230;within Grumpy&#8217;s combat range. Grumpy and his gf gave them a quick trip back to the cloning center &#8212; no mercy for non-entertainer malcontents! &#8212; then went stalking for a few more.</p>
<p>The /shout went out that there were overts in town. All hell started breaking loose then as red dots starting springing out of the woodwork. A couple Grumpy sympathizers asked for an invite, but, as far as Grumpy could tell, all they did was sit around chatting outside the cantina while Grumpy did all the work. Next time, Grumpy hopes they just start their own raid instead of tagging along on Grumpy&#8217;s. </p>
<p>There was a small group of players that gave Grumpy&#8217;s raid some real trouble. Grumpy could not hit those bastages with any reliability, which was very annoying and proved ultimately fatal. One of the group explained that they were KNOWN STACKERS, which Grumpy didn&#8217;t know anything about, but for d*mn sure wanted for himself. His gf shouted across the room &#8220;what is that?&#8221;; Grumpy just shrugged, hoping to find a clue in the rebuff-time conversation. </p>
<p>Later, the guy explained that those players had multiple +defense skills, which was like cheating, because it made them very difficult to hit. His gf wanted to know how that was cheating and Grumpy pointed out the obvious. Namely, because he and his gf (and the rest of his group, apparently) didn&#8217;t think of it first. Sheesh.</p>
<p>They ended their murderous rampage by picking off a few hapless overts that wandered into the local cantina. It was a good night&#8217;s work cleansing the free lands of disease and blight. Grumpy had even gained some insight into a few minor &#8220;adjustments&#8221; he should make to his almost-l337 combat stealth alt. </p>
<p>His gf was rather pleased also with how well they had done and complimented Grumpy on a largely successful PvP raid. Grumpy, never one to miss a golden opportunity, told his gf there was only one way to end such a productive gaming night.</p>
<p>Victory sex.</p>
