			<p>Grumpy had a refreshing vacation while ALL the vendors were on strike. Grumpy sure as h*ll wasn&#8217;t going to spend all his precious gaming time waiting for his vendor &#8220;Downloading Data&#8230;&#8221;, so he went to do more productive things like fishing and killing horses on Endor with his stealth alt. Once the vendors were at least operational, it was time to restock, sweep out the stores and get back to hardcore mining. (Which is different than mining the web for porn while at work, noobs. But not much different.)</p>
<p>When Grumpy got back to his architect, he had mountains of email to read through. Mostly, &#8220;yo dawg, I can&#8217;t access your vendors&#8221;, which were all deleted after Grumpy thought to himself &#8220;no sh*t. you new around here?&#8221; There were SOME sales, barely enough to keep the empire afloat. Naturally, his gf/business partner&#8217;s vast Weaponsmith Empire didn&#8217;t even notice A DENT in sales while the vendors were down. Apparently HER customers have an attention span greater than a gnat&#8217;s and were willing to camp her vendors until they showed some sign of life.</p>
<p>There were a few emails that required prompt /addignores. (See? Grumpy does it all the time.) One was from some yo yo dawg that bought furniture from Grumpy back when all he could make were orange couches and metal bookcases, not even fit to store fishing poles. The yo yo wanted to return all the furniture for full credit on a new set of Master Architect furniture, which frankly, isn&#8217;t much more attractive than orange couches and metal bookcases.</p>
<p>After answering (well, mostly deleting) the emails, emptying and reloading the factories, stuffing all the vendors full of stock, reviewing his mining spreadsheets and making a few notations of resources to ridiculously markup and some to dump at any price, he was done. Grumpy was anxious to get back to killing horses or flagpoles before any of his customers noticed Grumpy was online. So he shouted over to his gf&#8230;you almost done?!?! ETA?!?! CMON let&#8217;s hustle here!!! His gf shouted back&#8230;(and he quotes)..&#8221;I spent five months waiting for you to finish your SW business deals before you were free for the night, you can spend 5 minutes waiting for me now.&#8221; </p>
<p>Grumpy shouted&#8230;So 5 minutes then?</p>
<p>Which was the wrong response, he can see now. His gf gave him a list of things she needed done, mostly shopping and resource hunting (/feign deafness) AND getting rid of the Dead Vendor in Store_2. A few months back, Grumpy let some chick drop a vendor in Store_2. Normally, Grumpy doesn&#8217;t allow this but he was in a generous mood that night and she kept /fiddling with Grumpy&#8217;s gear, (which is a very interesting emote indeed), and before Grumpy&#8217;s big head started doing the thinking again, the vendor had been dropped and stocked. And, as far as Grumpy can tell, the vendor was stocked ONCE because it&#8217;s been empty for months, and Grumpy never saw the fiddler again. Honest.</p>
<p>Grumpy redid his petition, fully expecting to get the standard &#8220;Check the knowledge base, my good fellow&#8221; response, followed by the incredibly-insightful &#8220;Redeed your house, %PlayerName&#8221; and marked as resolved by the &#8220;DELETE THIS D*MN PETITION, ASSHAT&#8221; reply. This night, however, Grumpy must have caught one of the Sony workers actually at their desk because a LIVE PERSON sent a tell asking how they could assist Grumpy on this fine evening. /bow /wave /greet</p>
<p>Grumpy explained his predicament, leaving out the part about the fiddling, of course. And while CSRSkippy (or something) was sympathetic, there was nothing he could do as the fiddler may return to SWG after her three month absence and be so distraught over a missing empty vendor, she might burst into tears. But Grumpy could take matters into his own hands and redeed the house, friend, and be sure to have safe travels throughout the galaxy! Grumpy wondered how much that helpful LIVE! suggestion just cost him out of his monthly fee and hatched his own plan to &#8220;take matters into his own hands&#8221;.</p>
<p>Grumpy killed his custom order vendor and made a new vendor &#8212; the plumpest, tallest, bulkiest wookie the random generator would give him &#8212; and dropped it right in front of the Dead Vendor. A fine temporary solution, although Grumpy realized he would eventually have to resort to deceit and guile to get the vendor cleared out. And hope for a better roll on the random CSR generator.</p>
<p>Grumpy crossed that task off his list and congratulated himself on getting so much work done. He shouted over to his gf&#8230;ETA??? </p>
<p>No answer, but he had a new email. From his gf. Inside was a new to do list and a revised ETA of&#8230;. 5 more minutes.</p>
