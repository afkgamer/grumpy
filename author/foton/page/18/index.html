				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Still high on their successful (ultimately, that is) Dathomir adventure, Grumpy suggested the next night that they try another Adventure! planet. To encourage his gf/business partner&#8217;s participation, he even suggested they could get Master Doctor buffs if that was what her heart desired. (hehe)</p>
<p>She did want buffs (and, honestly, so did Grumpy after the &#8220;Enraged Rancor Incident&#8221;). They ported down to Coronet and watched the shouts to see if any Docs were selling buffs. This being prime time, there were 42 doctors dishing out the good stuff, all surrounded by several meditating TK&#8217;s. Once they were stuffed with buffs, they again faced the planet selection list. (Still no Yavin I, II, or III.) Grumpy decided, after some thought, that Endor could be the Land of Milk and Honey for them.</p>
<p>They selected a few mid-level missions to test their mettle and generated the swoops. Within the first 10 minutes of being on Endor, they were somewhat confident that they might actually have an Adventure! here. No lag like on Lok or Holocron Planet, almost empty of other players and asshats (emphasis on ALMOST) and not many annoying hills to chug up and down. A warning for the few players that are more noob than Grumpy about the Adventure! planets (certainly there must be two or three more noob than Grumpy), Grumpy thinks almost everything on Endor deathblows. He also thinks a well-timed deathblow is just the game&#8217;s way of telling him that it&#8217;s fishing time.</p>
<p>They decided they didn&#8217;t like the gleaming lantern bird missions as the d*mn things run when low on health, which could lead to an unfortunate cloning incident if the bird ran close enough to a lair of red and ferocious mobs. And Grumpy HAS to chase them eventually if he&#8217;s going to get his /harvest, which is far more important than gaining more combat levels.</p>
<p>Grumpy would like to get a destroy mission sometime that offers a reward for killing some of those Endor mission givers. He&#8217;s more than a little annoyed when he gets within 200 meters of the original waypoint that the lair reappears 1000 meters in the opposite direction. Or, after he&#8217;s hooked on doing cat missions, the terminals try to tempt him into doing deadly-poisonous insect missions conveniently placed next to an outpost of frenzied and foaming marauders. The blatant false advertising and bait-and-switch tactics are ample justification for killing that Girl Terrorized by Local Wildlife, in his opinion.</p>
<p>After recovering from a near-fatal poisoning incident, they switched to horse missions, bodorks, or something like that, which was very productive and exciting too when the horses would cheat with a Knockdown/Dizzy combo &#8212; Grumpy would flop around on the grass trying to stand up while his gf laughed at him and asked if he was going to help out any time soon. Grumpy gave her some payback tho, by attacking the lair with abandon while mobs spawned all over and asked for heals while she was flopping on the grass .. NOW!!! BEFORE HE DIES!!!</p>
<p>When they arrived at one of the horse missions, they discovered that some of their horses were attacking the mobs at a nearby lair. Holy exploit! Grumpy&#8217;s mobs were griefing some guy&#8217;s mission!!!!! Grumpy asked his gf if she wanted to bet on which mobs would win, but she reminded him of his OFFHAND REMARK that he was going to cut down on gambling. Since this wasn&#8217;t sports, Grumpy didn&#8217;t think some drunken resolution he MIGHT have made should apply.</p>
<p>He decided instead that they should help out their own mobs in griefing the other mission, because, that way, they could have the /harvests from both sets of mobs. Grumpy is clever that way.</p>
<p>They ended their night heavy with credits, combat experience and harvests. Grumpy&#8217;s gf was happy because they might actually become Master combat somethings one day, which was very much in doubt after some of their Adventure! planet visits.</p>
<p>There was still much work to do, however, before they would be ready to &#8230; KILL A MOB WITH LOOT WORTH A D*MN!! And, according to Grumpy&#8217;s detailed research, they better hurry as there&#8217;s only about a handful left.</p>
