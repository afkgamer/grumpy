			<p>A few days ago, Grumpy&#8217;s gf/business partner asked him if he followed the SWG message boards at all.</p>
<p>Grumpy is Jack&#8217;s Cold Sweat.</p>
<p>Acting casual, he told her&#8230;umm, read a few posts there, why? Of course, even someone that knows less about women than Grumpy (there must be someone out there), would know that she probably wouldn&#8217;t be enchanted to have some of their SWG and RL misadventures chronicled in such a public arena.</p>
<p>It seemed his gf, in her never-ending quest to become the 11th best weaponsmith on the server, wanted to start watching the board auctions for any good resources. Grumpy was fast to volunteer to do this for her! A little too fast!! She was immediately suspicious.</p>
<p>Grumpy is Jack&#8217;s Innocent Look.</p>
<p>Grumpy backpedaled, verbally. He explained that he should do more to help her business, why, she had spent so much of her game time helping him out and building their vast architectural empire, it was HIGH TIME that he assisted her&#8230;.with credits, and finding resources and most especially, monitoring those message boards for her, so she need never read them. Ever.</p>
<p>His gf then wrote out a list of a million stats and such that would make these &#8220;weapons worthy of the gods&#8221; and apparently expects him to save that list, poring over the auctions in search of said stats. For crissakes, Grumpy couldn&#8217;t give a slumrat&#8217;s ass about stats. Grumpy stashed the list. He figured he&#8217;d just throw credits at someone and maybe she&#8217;ll be satisfied for an hour.</p>
<p>The next day, Grumpy&#8217;s gf asked for an update, had he found anything worthwhile to bid on? Grumpy was happy to report, truthfully even!, that he had bid on some resources, but lost out, however, he was confident that he will succeed on her behalf soon! She wanted to use his login to check on his bid, as Grumpy had been struck with sudden amnesia when asked about the particulars.</p>
<p>Grumpy is Jack&#8217;s Racing Heartbeat.</p>
<p>Grumpy got a lightbulb over his head! He should sit at the starports and watch the in-game auctions for valuable never-to-be-seen-again resources which would surely be cheaper than on the message boards&#8230;and he would hurl credits at the auctioneer until they submitted to his offers. And he would buy huge quantities&#8230;quantities so huge that even the vast Sony databases would be lagged out, yet again, by his transactions. And if he happened to get in a few /shouts of the stores&#8217; waypoints, then that&#8217;s all the better.</p>
<p>She agreed to this, although, in Grumpy&#8217;s defense, he did point out to her that using his login would be a gross violation of the SWG TOS. Which Grumpy considers a manifesto of the same caliber as The U.S. Constitution. Honest. </p>
<p>Well, the gods were smiling on Grumpy that night as he found some aluminum-something-or-other being auctioned in Coronet that his gf/business partner took a fancy to. /shrug Apparently, Grumpy can expect to get a WEAPON WORTHY OF THE GODS now, and she&#8217;s happy, the auctioneer is happy and Grumpy is just about broke and destitute. Whoever is the 11th best weaponsmith on the server, look out.</p>
<p>Grumpy is Jack&#8217;s Narrow Escape.</p>
