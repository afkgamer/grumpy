			<p>Grumpy&#8217;s RL girlfriend is his SWG business partner. She&#8217;s a master crafter too. Grumpy really hopes this works out because it could be bad for business if it doesn&#8217;t. He tries to behave as best he can for this reason alone.</p>
<p>Grumpy knows more about resources than he knows about women, but he knows this much: Keeping his mouth shut is his best option.</p>
<p>Sometimes Grumpy runs low on supplies and has to sneak some resources out of her workshop. He thinks what she doesn&#8217;t know won&#8217;t hurt her. She might be angry if she knew Grumpy was using 995 conductivity copper to make furniture. One time, Grumpy took a crate of her very very special FWG&#8217;s that were more precious than life itself and hid them under his stack of ore. Grumpy thought that was hilarious. She threw a pencil at him IRL. That coulda put his eye out! </p>
<p>Two days ago she wanted to take a night off from the SWG business. Grumpy thought that could be financial suicide! Grumpy suggested McDonald&#8217;s to speed along this &#8220;together time&#8221; thing. She musta thought it was more an Arby&#8217;s night because she called Grumpy a name that begins with A and ends in hole. </p>
<p>Last week, Grumpy&#8217;s miner told him that he would have to live off his stockpiled resources for a few days to wait for the next shift. Grumpy was dubious but agreed. Three days into the drought, Grumpy was starving for resources and by Day Four, he was performing illegal favors AND paying 3 per unit for any kind of metal. Grumpy was a junkie needing a fix. He decided he would have to fire the miner and take control of the situation before he tried to use his gf&#8217;s Krayt tissue in Sofa Chairs. </p>
<p>Grumpy&#8217;s gf told him he couldn&#8217;t &#8220;fire&#8221; anyone in SWG&#8230;she was wrong. After Grumpy had a talk with the miner MOSTLY INVOLVING ALL CAPS AND WORDS THAT WOULD BE EDITED OUT BY THE MSG BOARD FILTER, Grumpy cut him loose. </p>
<p>Two days later, Grumpy&#8217;s fusions dried up. Grumpy knew this could get serious. He had a week&#8217;s supply stored up. But a week goes by quickly and Grumpy wouldn&#8217;t have ANY fishing time if he had to hunt for radioactive every day. Grumpy tried to get his gf to talk to the miner. Grumpy had to listen to a bunch of &#8220;I told you so&#8217;s&#8221; and the even-more cryptic &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to tell you I told you so&#8221;. He thinks that&#8217;s really just another way of saying &#8220;I told you so&#8221;. </p>
<p>Grumpy told her that part of her job was to clean up his messes. He thought this was an incredible compliment to her&#8230;he was wrong. Grumpy even promised to stop shouting at the starports that she would dance in a fleshwrap if people ran to his stores. Grumpy thinks his gf is stubborn. He probably shouldn&#8217;t have said that out loud tho.</p>
<p>Grumpy found a new miner and he learned a valuable lesson. His couch is very uncomfortable to sleep on.</p>
