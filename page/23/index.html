				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Grumpy returned from his holiday break to his rl office where he was happy to discover that none of his co-workers or subordinates had done any work at all in his absence. Grumpy would like to think this is because Grumpy is so indispensable and his work is so groundbreaking, that only he hiimself could do the work. But really this is because his coworkers and subordinates don&#8217;t want Grumpy to feel unwanted. Or something like that.</p>
<p>While Grumpy was gone from his MiddleManager913 job at GreatAmericanCorporation487, he had plenty of time to do his life&#8217;s work&#8230;leading the glamorous SWG life of a Master Merchant in charge of a vast Architectural Empire. Alarmingly, Grumpy learned last week that his gf/business partner&#8217;s weapons sales are starting to kick the crap out of Grumpy&#8217;s sales. Grumpy acted happy to learn this and was outwardly encouraging, however, this recent turn of events has meant some disturbing changes around his SWG household.</p>
<p>Like yo yo dawgs asking Grumpy about the Weaponsmith stock and stats and weapon repair and&#8230;WORST OF ALL&#8230;if Grumpy would ask his gf/business partner what weapon she thought best for a particular situation. For crissakes, Grumpy doesn&#8217;t keep up on stats and he most certainly is not going to get out of his chair to go ask his gf for her opinions on Laser-something-or-others. One noob even wanted Grumpy to TAKE A MESSAGE and give it to his gf when she returned from hunting and gathering at the grocery store. /addignore noob (and he might ban the noob from the store later if he remembers&#8230;on principal!)</p>
<p>In the past, when Grumpy&#8217;s gf needed credits to buy The Best Weaponsmith Resources Ever, naturally Grumpy would supply this without question, maybe he&#8217;d add a little /pat on the head and chuckle to himself how cute it was that she enjoyed her chosen crafting profession. Grumpy thinks if this run on weapons continues much longer, HE could be the one getting a /pat on the head and maybe even put in charge of sweeping off the porch and emptying the store trash cans at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Grumpy and his gf spent quite a bit of time last week playing on their stealth alts, both of which have healing capabilities &#8212; which is good, as they need a lot of healing nowadays, since The Great Pet Nerf of 2003. Grumpy discovered that healing supplies cost a good chunk of change, so he suggested to his gf that they would have to start mining the related resources and set up a factory to produce these. His gf thought this was ridiculous, that their Master characters could easily afford to purchase any necessary items and if he was running short on credits, she could make the purchases on their behalf. (Do you see what Grumpy means? This Weaponsmith BS is a slippery slope.)</p>
<p>When Grumpy was in an evil and very anti-Christmasy mood, he entertained some thoughts about subtle &#8220;adjustments&#8221; he could make in the SWG business model that might stress the almost-vast Weaponsmith Empire, like claiming to need 1 million units of ore&#8230;NOW!! BEFORE SHE LOGS OFF!!! or, using her OQ1000 gas to make dozens of crates of generator turbines, or, sending her to purchase anything advertised as &#8220;pre-nerf&#8221;. But then he came to an important realization.</p>
<p>The morphing of the vast Architectural Empire into a vast Weaponsmith Empire could mean more goofing-off time for Grumpy, which is what he does best. More time to /prone outside a busy starport, looking for spare change on the ground. More time to drag red and angry mobs down to the Nymrod&#8217;s Stronghold starport on Lok. More time to call out his smoking, flaming swoop in Anchorhead while /shouting IMPS INCOMING!!!!, so he can watch the two overt rebels (out of 500) come running out of the Tavern. </p>
<p>But especially, more time with his beloved. The Fishmaster 3000000.</p>
