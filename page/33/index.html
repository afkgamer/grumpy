				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The one night Grumpy&#8217;s gf/business partner had some RL obligations in the evening and Grumpy found himself at loose ends. The stores were stocked, sales were slow, the employees had all been paid, and no sports on TV of any note. Grumpy REALLY needed to leave his starport floortile because some weirdos in underwear were wallowing around /prone&#8230; most of them men by the way (disturbing), so he thought to himself&#8230;.Why not visit another galaxy tonight and see if everyone in SWG is as twisted as that pile of humanoids in underwear.</p>
<p>Grumpy did a /sit /logout and selected a galaxy at random to create a new character.</p>
<p>Grumpy thought he would try something different on this galaxy, a different starting profession, another starting city&#8230;maybe, as the OTHER GENDER. Grumpy obviously knows already what it&#8217;s like to lead the glamorous SWG life of the wildly-successful Master Merchant overseeing a vast architectural empire. But, Grumpy, in his never-ending quest to provide vital information to the public, wanted to experience the game from this alternate world and viewpoint. (Actually, Grumpy was just getting bombed and being an asshat, but decided later to make it seem like he had a purpose.)</p>
<p>Grumpy made a female human character on a random galaxy (that wasn&#8217;t Loading&#8230;.), Novice Entertainer, and used the starting city of Bestine, mostly because everyone in Bestine seems so gd starved for attention that surely his social experiment would come to fruition that much faster. </p>
<p>Grumpy got spit out as a human female entertainer in Bestine and his initial thought was&#8230;gd, I&#8217;m hot. And his second thought was&#8230;w-t-h are these clothes they give to entertainer noobs?!?!?! That didn&#8217;t matter tho, Grumpy was on his way to the cantina to do his entertainer thing and hopefully he would do it AFK so he wouldn&#8217;t have to think about how weird of an area he was getting into here.</p>
<p>Grumpy is not making this up&#8230;within 5 minutes, three male characters had tipped Grumpy over 2k in credits each and provided armor, a rifle (true, they didn&#8217;t provide a UberKraytRifle, what asshats), 2 dancer type sets of clothes and 2 pets. Naturally Grumpy thought&#8230;for crying out loud, can I drop a vendor here yet??? Already got armor, rifle, clothes and pets to sell!!!!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Grumpy got a case of the guilts. Here he was, feigning noobness with &#8220;sorry, I&#8217;m new&#8221; and shiaz like that, and asking how to reply to tells and if there were NPC vendors in town for clothes and WHERE TO BUY SPELLS (Grumpy is dirt), and accepting tips/armor/weapons/clothes and a house!!! Well, guilt AND he was getting **edit** annoyed at having to pretend noobness all the time. </p>
<p>His gf arrived home and saved his morally-bankrupt soul by asking&#8230;just what in the h*ll did he think he was doing? Grumpy tried using the &#8220;social experiment&#8221; explanation, but she wasn&#8217;t buying any BS that night. She gave him a stern lecture about fradulent game behavior and accepting noob rifles under false pretenses, (punishable as a game felony probably), and that he had to go find each and every one of those players and return the items and any ill-gotten credits. Grumpy explained that technically, on this galaxy, HE WAS A NOOB and hadn&#8217;t asked to be given anything, but she just yelled again.</p>
<p>Hours (and several apologies) later, Grumpy had returned everything except for 200 credits he had been tipped by a Master Commando (cheap bastage) and logged out to delete his experimental character. </p>
<p>Grumpy didn&#8217;t really learn or see anything fascinating in that other bizarro galaxy &#8212; they had their proportionate share of holobots, idiot jedis and scammers; prices are about the same as on Eclipse; lots of &#8220;pwning&#8221; /shouts and trash talk between the tweener rebels and imps in the Bestine area. </p>
<p>One thing the bizarro galaxy had that Eclipse didn&#8217;t that night: a drunk asshat shaking his boootay for some pocket change.</p>
