				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>One night up on Endor, while having yet another successful Adventure!, Grumpy told his gf/business partner that he&#8217;d had enough of those stupid cheating horse missions. Eventually one of those horses was going to hit the jackpot, KD/dizzy both of them and have his way with their flopping bodies. Which seemed like it would be very unpleasant, kind of like spending a night in the County Jail over some misunderstanding about three dozen parking tickets.</p>
<p>His gf suggested they switch to blurg missions, which look like dinosaurs. The worst thing the dinosaurs do is spit green juice at people from a great distance, however, they must be quite a scourge to the locals as they pay d*mn good money to clear them out. On the way to their 23rd blurg mission, Grumpy&#8217;s gf fell off her swoop, flat on her back, incapp&#8217;d from a 1k mind hit. Resisting the urge to laugh hysterically at her predicament, Grumpy asked what in the h*ll had happened.</p>
<p>Apparently, some Blurg Raptor (or Rapper, Grumpy doesn&#8217;t have SS&#8217;s of this thing /shrug) had spit green juice at her head and incapped her. Grumpy launched into another his lectures about always being jacked up on +Mind food and drink, for crissakes, how many times did he have to remind her?!?!?! No great harm done now tho, they just waited around for the incap timer and mapped out a strategy. His gf&#8217;s suggestion was to leave the thing alone, after all, it was listed on the SWG site as a RAID LEVEL MOB. Oh no. </p>
<p>Naturally, Grumpy was all for taking on this yo yo dawg, just point him in the right direction. He didn&#8217;t need to hunt around &#8212; the raptor was waiting for them at their next mission. Hungry and with a mouth full of green juice.</p>
<p>As Grumpy was a slightly higher level l337 combat dewd than his gf, he would be the lead fighter.. or so he assumed. He jacked up on food and drink, which apparently infuriated the Raptor because it charged and brought all of its blurg buddies along. His gf took out the little guys and tossed a few heals at Grumpy, then came to help with the RAID LEVEL MOB. If Grumpy were to define help as stealing the aggro and getting the piss beaten out of her. Which he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Grumpy said ummmm. And errrr. Then finally he just said, &#8220;Hail, aggro control, where are you?&#8221; Which is something he used to yell about ALL THE TIME in EverQuest, and which might mean nothing to EQ noobs. In this situation, however, it&#8217;s as if his gf forgot everything about aggro control and was trying to kill steal a RAID LEVEL MOB from her own partner. Grumpy had to burn nearly an entire stack of stims trying to save her over-aggro ass, and in the end, she still took a deathblow. For crying out loud, Grumpy could have just saved his stims and the effort.</p>
<p>Grumpy finished the raptor off, checked the corpse for loot (none, of course), got his harvest and waited around for her return. He wisely choose to remain silent while she got fresh buffs to finish the missions, knowing that &#8220;The Raptor Incident&#8221; could easily turn into a RL argument, possibly involving finger pointing and pencil throwing too.</p>
<p>They finished off their missions then noticed that the raptor had respawned and was roaming around again. Grumpy asked his gf if she wanted to kill it, but she declined, declaring that mob was a waste of time.</p>
<p>Grumpy thought&#8230;maybe for her it&#8217;s a waste of time. /snicker</p>
