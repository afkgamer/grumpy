			<p>Grumpy knows all about Stryk&#8217;er. or is it Stry&#8217;ker? or Styr&#8217;ker? Grumpy isn&#8217;t sure how his name is spelled, but he knows all about him. Grumpy would look up how to spell his name, but Grumpy&#8217;s RL boss might object. Writing up his previous night&#8217;s adventures kinda counts as work because sometimes Grumpy checks his email while he&#8217;s doing it. </p>
<p>Stryker is his gf/business partner&#8217;s chief competitor. Grumpy has to hear alot of complaining about Strykeer during the &#8220;together time&#8221; thing. Grumpy tries to put her on RL addignore and think about how much stock he should put out for the weekend crowds, but she caught him doing that and threatened to hide the remote control! </p>
<p>Sometimes Grumpy has to send over a stealth alt to check on prices for his gf. Grumpy thinks she should do that herself. Why should he be the one getting banned from malls all the time?</p>
<p>Grumpy has toyed with the idea of playing a harmless prank on Strykerr involving an army of heavy mineral harvesters with long and disturbing names, but everyone knows placing a heavy on Corellia is harder to do than winning a national lottery. If he could think of a good prank to make Strykrr turn over all his precious resources to his gf FOR FREE, maybe his gf would be so grateful that Grumpy would be her hero!&#8230;and appropriate displays of gratitude would be included!</p>
<p>He also considered claiming that using one of Stryke&#8217;r&#8217;s weapons gave him an unsightly skin rash and CANCER, but doubted anyone would believe that. And Grumpy doesn&#8217;t want to get anymore tells from noob doctors offering to heal him in the med center 378km away from the starport. Get a droid, noob, Grumpy doesn&#8217;t like to move off his floor tile by the starport.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Grumpy&#8217;s gf told him that if only he would run to 6 different planets every night to place all 30 harvesters on incredibly-rare, never-to-be-seen-again resources, then she could be more competitive as a weaponsmith. Grumpy wanted to explain that there was nothing wrong with being the 12th best weaponsmith on the server, but he was on his best behavior last night and pretending to be &#8220;Mr. Sensitive to Your Needs&#8221; Guy. </p>
<p>Grumpy was firm on one point, however. She could not use any of HIS ore mines to get non-ore resources. That would be finanical suicide! Why should they kill the golden goose (his business) to help her cute little weaponsmith hobby? Certainly she can find all she needs on the bazaar. Grumpy suggested while she&#8217;s checking the bazaar terminals, constantly, for days on end, that she could do some /shouting of the stores&#8217; /waypoints. And wearing a fleshwrap while she did that wouldn&#8217;t hurt either.</p>
<p>Grumpy learned a few things. Apparently her hobby isn&#8217;t a hobby and it isn&#8217;t cute either. And there is no way in &#8220;hades&#8221; that she is wearing a fleshwrap to help the business. O yeah, and Grumpy should just keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>Grumpy did agree to run all over for hours to find some resource that will produce WEAPONS WORTHY OF THE GODS. If Grumpy can&#8217;t sell it later at grossly-inflated prices, Grumpy doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the trouble, but Grumpy, for once, kept his mouth shut. While he was running all over to find a field suitable for building on, he did find the Lost City of Atlantis, the Holy Grail and a previously-undiscovered Egyptian tomb filled with riches. No 90 ore fields tho. </p>
<p>Ya, Grumpy knows all about Stryyker. Dirty bastage.</p>
