				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>One of Grumpy&#8217;s game buds asked Grumpy&#8217;s stealth alt to come help kill some Lord Nyax over on Corellia. Grumpy&#8217;s buds are pleased to learn of his new semi-half-ass-partial-commitment to transforming his stealth alt into a character at least semi-half-ass-partially capable of combat. As one of his &#8220;friends&#8221; said, &#8220;for crissakes, I was tired of healing your incapp&#8217;d ass&#8221;.</p>
<p>So after receiving very explicit instructions on how to get to this Lord dude (for crying out loud, Grumpy knows how to use the POI waypoints), Grumpy shuttled and swooped his way over to the Nyax building. Even though it only took Grumpy all of about 5 minutes to arrive, his bud kept asking if he was almost there?, is he close?, did he get lost?, eta? Apparently, his bud needed company while they waited another 15 minutes for the other two players to arrive.</p>
<p>While downing a few drugs, food and slapping on some rudimentary buffs, the conversation naturally turned to what everyone&#8217;s Christmas/Holiday Holocron said..NOW!! BEFORE THEY LOG OFF!! One guy had to be a pistoleer, another a squad leader (hehe) and the last guy had to master Chef, NOW!! BEFORE HE LOGS OFF!! Grumpy thinks the Chef holocron is custom-issued to all the commandos and TKMs, so they too can experience the joy of carpal tunnel syndrome from crafter clicking.</p>
<p>Then it was Grumpy&#8217;s turn. What did his alt&#8217;s holocron tell him to do? Master Architect or Merchant?? Which everyone agreed, would be very funny indeed. Grumpy told them he had no idea what his holocrons say.</p>
<p>*insert uncomfortable pause in the conversation here*</p>
<p>They demanded to know why not. Normally, Grumpy would launch into one of his anti-holocron rants and how he&#8217;s more independent-minded and he&#8217;ll be d*mned if some entertainment conglomerate is gonna tell him how to spend his free time, but in the interest of not having to type out multiple paragraphs all ending with multiple exclamation points !!!! &#8212; indicating how strongly he felt &#8212; Grumpy just told them he hadn&#8217;t gotten around to it yet. To which they all /nodded as if his answer made any kind of sense at all.</p>
<p>Just as they were preparing to clear the Nyax camp, three combat dawgs showed up and started clearing all the red and angry mobs for them. Grumpy thought this was great, less work for them. But his buds were enraged and told the new arrivals to wait for the respawn. The new arrivals disagreed and continued to kill until the Lord sent all three packing, back to the cloning center.</p>
<p>As none of them had pets worth a d*mn anymore, the TKM-soon-to-be-Chef would have to be the tank for this fight. Grumpy suggested he hurl bofa treats for extra damage; the TKM chuckled and said he would &#8220;deal&#8221; with Grumpy later. !!!! Grumpy put on his special edition goggles, in the hopes that the TKM wouldn&#8217;t hit an UNARMED Novice Scout/Marksman/Brawler/Medic with glasses.</p>
<p>They soon dispatched the Lord and Grumpy&#8217;s buds were disappointed that he only had grenades as loot. Grumpy didn&#8217;t know if this was good or bad, but by their reaction, this was a collosal waste of their elite combat time. They finished off the rest of the red and angry mobs inside the Nyax building and his buds told Grumpy that he might get a badge from this! Grumpy didn&#8217;t know what a badge was (other than his Master Merchant/Master Architect badges, he&#8217;s never gotten any), but acted like this would be a very good thing to get indeed.</p>
<p>No badge for that camp tho, his buds grumbled again and talked about all the other POIs that were much better than this one with NO grenades and BADGES FOR ALL, maybe free refreshments afterwards too, Grumpy didn&#8217;t know. The three combat dawgs arrived back to the camp about then, fresh from their clonings and began complaining in /say how the new POIs were ruining all of their former hunting grounds with noobs.</p>
<p>Grumpy did a /think Which is noober, cloning or actually killing your target? The three combat dawgs kind of crowded around Grumpy then in a threatening manner and asked what Grumpy was. Grumpy told them he was a person. They demanded to know his title, what was he d*mmit?!?!?!</p>
<p>Besides a Novice Scout/Marksman/Brawler/Medic on a mission (that offers no loot or badges)? Why, Grumpy is nothing. But he has plans, oh yes, he most definitely has plans.</p>
