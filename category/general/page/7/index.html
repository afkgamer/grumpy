				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Now that Grumpy&#8217;s stealth alt is an uber fantastic, almost in god-mode, l337357 of l337z  combat dude, he is very much in demand to come rescue all sorts of people in distress.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;not really. But recently one of his buds asked Grumpy what he was doing, and after learning that Grumpy had no gaming plans for the night, he asked Grumpy to shuttle over to his city and help defend their bases. Grumpy weighed his options &#8212; killing Endorian dinosaurs that spit annoying green juice or killing people that might send cursing /tells later. The possibility of cursing /tells wins every time!</p>
<p>After he arrived at his bud&#8217;s town, they showed him around the city and the detachment headquarters. The PA&#8217;s main combat dude specifically pointed out the cloning and insurance terminals to Grumpy, and Grumpy was about to say &#8220;No thank you, I&#8217;ll have no need for those&#8221; when one of the scouts spotted some blue dots a short distance from town. </p>
<p>Important safety tip: blue dots BAD, red dots BAD, purple dots GOOD!</p>
<p>The attacking force&#8217;s opening strategy seemed to include about five minutes of /shouted trash talk by their covert members, followed by some lazy swoop circles to count all the Novice Artisans in the crowd. Some of the trash talk was about the city structures that his bud&#8217;s PA had cleverly placed in a less-than-artistic way around the bases to restrict enemy movement. Grumpy didn&#8217;t know whether that was an exploit or not &#8212; he was too busy getting buffs and stuffing himself with food and drink to worry about statues and fountains. </p>
<p>At first, Grumpy didn&#8217;t think his bud&#8217;s PA had too much to worry about as their bases were loaded with sympathetic NPCs that kept telling them &#8220;You&#8217;re a sight for sore eyes!&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll be safe here!&#8221; This was before Grumpy figured out that the NPCs on the outside of the base are completely WORTHLESS and easily killed by anyone with a survival knife. The NPCs inside aren&#8217;t too bright either as one of them told Grumpy &#8220;Halt!&#8221; when he went inside to /declare. </p>
<p>Important safety tip: HQ NPCs like to talk big.</p>
<p>Finally, the overts arrived with their Master Combat Medic at the lead. Based on his bud&#8217;s reaction and Grumpy&#8217;s own sinking mind pool, this was not good news. Everyone was ordered to DB the MCMs, then find and DB the Master Doctors. Which was no easy task as this Teras Kasi Master took a disliking to Grumpy and came after him. Grumpy knew better than to let a TKM get too close and ran around a bit before getting lucky with some big hits. Just as he was about to DB the TKM&#8217;s incapped ass, the TKM bounced up and, Grumpy coulda swore, he smirked at Grumpy before smashing his head in.</p>
<p>Important safety tip: Until you see &#8220;Corpse of TKM&#8221; on the body, keep a safe distance.</p>
<p>A few clonings later, the enemy had been successfully repelled before they could get the codes to the bases, (which Grumpy learned would be VERY BAD), and the Good Guys gathered in one of those Camps As Large As Grumpy&#8217;s Main Store to heal up and speculate whether the enemy was done for the night. The PA Leader thanked all the guests for coming to their aid and made some speech that Grumpy didn&#8217;t pay much attention to because he was still getting cursing /tells.</p>
<p>One in particular caught his eye, from the Master Bounty Hunter that Grumpy had waxed right before he could slice the base terminal: I know where you live, phag.</p>
<p>Important safety tip: Don&#8217;t invite Master Bounty Hunters over for dinner and polite conversation.</p>
