				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Grumpy was restocking his main store, minding his own business (Grumpy is punny), when a noob sent him a tell, desperate for some grinding steel. O great, Grumpy thought, yet another holo-tect. Grumpy asked how many units the noob was looking for and the stats he needed and then Grumpy MIGHT go to the resource shed and check what he had.</p>
<p>Of course, Grumpy has been banned for weeks now from his gf/business partner&#8217;s workshop ever since he used some Copper-that-will-never-be-seen-again to make furniture. And by that, Grumpy means he is actually on the ban list. After dragging his feet for a while, he ran and checked what steel he had on hand and Grumpy did indeed have some steel to spare for the noob. Grumpy will quote the actual conversation (as Grumpy is too busy to set up a website for his screenshots)&#8230;.Grumpy&#8217;s mental commentary is in parentheses.</p>
<p>Grumpy is NOT MAKING THIS UP.</p>
<p>Holo-tect: do u have any steel will pay lots.<br />Holo-tect: do u have any steel will pay lots plz (Grumpy gives kharma points for please even though the holo-tect was too busy to spell it out.)<br />Grumpy: I do, how many units you looking for?<br />Holo-tect: about 3k<br />Holo-tect: i need it bad (Don&#8217;t we all?)<br />Grumpy: ok ok, we&#8217;ll get you fixed up, dont worry  <br />Holo-tect: ow fank god!!! (w-t-h, did he just curse at Grumpy? or is that l33t sp3ak?)<br />Holo-tect: i hav been needing it for weeks now<br />Grumpy: I have kobakov. Is this for grinding? or you need a particular stat?<br />Holo-tect: grinding<br />Grumpy: Ok, this is nice cheap steel, not great stat wise<br />Holo-tect: ok that is 1000% fine (mathematically impossible, but Grumpy won&#8217;t hold that against him)<br />Grumpy: ok, is 3cpu acceptable to you?<br />Holo-tect: and this is on off chance u have ore and alu i need some but not right now<br />Holo-tect: ya if that is 3k or more<br />Grumpy: Ya, i can spare up to 9k units of it, how much you want<br />Holo-tect: wow well i use alot how much 4 4kish (apparently math isn&#8217;t his strong point&#8230;errr, isn&#8217;t 4k units at 3 cpu 12k in credits? Grumpy figured he better spell out exactly what they were talking about here.)<br />Grumpy: 4000 units would be 12000 credits at 3 cpu<br />Holo-tect: omg<br />Holo-tect: that is alot for 4k<br />Holo-tect: i will have to go for 2k :/<br />Grumpy: Ok, sorry cant let it go for less than 3cpu<br />Grumpy: 2k would be 6000 credits (Grumpy is still doing the math for the holo-tect to make sure they understand each other. Grumpy is grateful that trigonometry isn&#8217;t necessary to price his goods or else he&#8217;d never make a sale.)<br />Holo-tect: ok now im sorry if i unsult u i now i need it bad but RIP OFF (h*ll no, why would Grumpy consider THAT an insult, he&#8217;s called a thief almost every day.)<br />Holo-tect: I COULD GET 1k FOR CHEAPER AND IT IS LOW QUALITY<br />Grumpy: Ok, then do that, sorry cant help you</p>
<p>Grumpy considers the conversation done at this point. If Holo-tect has access to such cheap steel, as he claims, why the h*ll is he bothering Grumpy? About five minutes pass&#8230;.</p>
<p>Holo-tect: is it 2k for 4000<br />Holo-tect: i will pay that since im despreate (Grumpy was losing his patience at this point. He doesn&#8217;t log on to babysit punk architects or to finance them until they get on their feet.)<br />Grumpy: Dude. there is steel on the bazaar, you may find 2 cpu there, but most of its going to be 3 cpu, even grinding stuff. only can get lower prices by buying large quantites, like 10k or more.</p>
<p>Grumpy considered the conversation, hopefully, done. </p>
<p>But no!!! Holo-tect proceeds to tell Grumpy that Grumpy is the worst architect on the server and Holo-tect will make it his game life&#8217;s mission to make sure that no one shops at his stores. Grumpy figures everyone already KNOWS that he is the worst architect on the server (and a thief too, apparently), so Grumpy wasn&#8217;t concerned by the threats.</p>
<p>Then, Holo-tect delivered the &#8220;deathblow&#8221;. Holo-tect was RL best friends with a MASTER BOUNTY HUNTER on the server (probably rich and famous too) and he was going to take out a BOUNTY ON GRUMPY, presumably because Grumpy wasn&#8217;t giving away steel that day. After his rl best friend got done with Grumpy (which was going to be some trick as Grumpy is neutral), everyone would know how gay, lame and &#8220;cat-like&#8221; (errr, something like that) Grumpy was!</p>
<p>Grumpy pointed out a few errors in Holo-tect&#8217;s logic:</p>
<p>1. Grumpy is neutral, and<br />2. Grumpy doesn&#8217;t give a slumrat&#8217;s a-s-s</p>
<p>At this point, Grumpy walked away from the computer to cool off as he feared he might tell some pre-teen to suck roosters and carnal-knowledge off, and that would be wrong. In theory.</p>
<p>So Grumpy is going to save Holo-tect the trouble&#8230;.Grumpy is THE WORST ARCHITECT ON THE SERVER and very possibly A THIEF ALSO and everyone should STAY AWAY because there is a price on Grumpy&#8217;s head and others in the vicinty could be harmed when the MASTER BOUNTY HUNTER arrives to throw Grumpy into Dante&#8217;s 9th Circle of Hell.</p>
