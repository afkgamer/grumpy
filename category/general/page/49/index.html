				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Grumpy thinks the GCW is silly. Grumpy likes to sell things to Rebels and Imperials alike. He thinks anyone is welcome at his stores as long as they&#8217;re on the &#8220;credit faction&#8221;. If they got credits, they got faction.</p>
<p>Sometimes Grumpy has to get involved in that whole reb/imp nonsense. A few weeks ago, Grumpy had to go visit his Bestine location. Grumpy isn&#8217;t fond of Tatooine and does not like to be summoned there to deal with any issues. Grumpy&#8217;s gf/business partner wants to move their home to Tatooine because the houses are &#8220;so pretty&#8221;. Grumpy thinks this is the LAST consideration in where to place a house. After all, it is impossible to pull a fish out of sand.</p>
<p>There is nowhere in all of the galaxy where the GCW is more evident than in the Bestine/Anchorhead area. Grumpy thinks this is cute. When he is in Bestine, he shouts that the rebels can go to &#8220;hades&#8221; and the imps need to shop at Grumpy&#8217;s store. When he is Anchorhead, he shouts that the imps can go to &#8220;hades&#8221; and the rebels need to shop at Grumpy&#8217;s store. Grumpy doesn&#8217;t think this is being a &#8220;sell-out&#8221;, he thinks that&#8217;s just good business.</p>
<p>Back to the recent incident&#8230;Grumpy got a tell from his Tatooine hustler that his Bestine manager was a traitor. Grumpy thought this meant that the manager was sending people to a competitor!! Thankfully, it wasn&#8217;t as serious as all that. His manager was telling the AH rebels when an overt/TEF&#8217;d imp was in his store. Grumpy doesn&#8217;t know much about women, but he does know that dead people can&#8217;t browse and spend their credits.</p>
<p>(This was a REAL emergency, not a fake emergency like when one of his gf&#8217;s SWG friends needs one potted plant IMMEDIATELY or the friend will burst into tears and become suicidal, distraught and clinically depressed.)</p>
<p>Grumpy doesn&#8217;t like Tat, but Grumpy enjoys the extra income he gets from pricing his merchandise a bit higher for his Tat customers&#8230;as a &#8220;you must be lonely out here on this god-forsaken planet&#8221; surcharge. It was obvious that this required a personal Grumpy visit. Grumpy&#8217;s not a bounty hunter, but he knows that in situations like this (similar to his &#8220;visits to the competition&#8221;), stealth is required and he ran an alt over to Bestine.</p>
<p>Grumpy&#8217;s initial observations were&#8230;Bestine hasn&#8217;t gotten any more interesting.. or populated ..since his last visit AND, it&#8217;s curious that his store manager thinks he can best serve Grumpy&#8217;s customers from OUTSIDE the store. Grumpy thought &#8220;something smelled rotten in Denmark&#8221;. (Grumpy&#8217;s apologies to his Danish customers that enjoy limburger cheese.) </p>
<p>It was easy to get his manager to admit his treachery. Fourteen-year-olds are easily fooled by adults that use language like &#8220;yo&#8221; &#8220;dawg&#8221; &#8220;werd up&#8221; and &#8220;shiz&#8221;. Grumpy learned all that from his customers. He likes to imagine that he&#8217;s kewl now. Even if his gf reminds him daily that he is not.</p>
<p>Grumpy &#8220;promoted&#8221; his Naboo manager to be his Tatooine manager. The 14-yr-old former-Naboo manager was very flattered, especially when Grumpy gave him a better title&#8230;REGIONAL manager&#8230;and a free medium Tat house! Grumpy starported over to Naboo to congratulate him and to pull a dozen rays out of the water. Not necessarily in that order.</p>
<p>shiz, werd up dawg, yo!</p>
