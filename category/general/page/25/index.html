				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A few days ago, some of Grumpy&#8217;s game buds (and better customers) asked Grumpy to go along on a hunting trip up on Dathomir. As Grumpy&#8217;s combat skills are limited to Pistol 4 and making wicked sofa chairs, Grumpy knew exactly what was behind this invite. Pity.</p>
<p>Grumpy welcomed the night off from the vast Architectural Empire, which had been weighing heavily on his shoulders lately, and starported up to the north ghetto area. Grumpy made sure he had his pistol equipped (which he often doesn&#8217;t) just in case his fan club of red and angry mobs were waiting for Grumpy upstairs.</p>
<p>It was just his buds tho and they were discussing strategy for doing some missions. Their first question was &#8220;Besides opening your crafting tool, what exactly can you do?&#8221;. Which was funny to Grumpy also&#8230;the first 5 times, after which he tired of that joke. His buds decided that 20k missions involving defiler-somethings wouldn&#8217;t get them killed (much), so Grumpy got 2 of those missions and managed not to say &#8220;HOLY SH*T, this kinda pay for 5 minutes work is criminal&#8221;.</p>
<p>His buds got on their bikes and waited for Grumpy to generate his swoop. Grumpy warned them to cover their ears and shield their eyes, as Grumpy&#8217;s swoop, at 200 HPs, is rather LOUD and flaming! when generated. Grumpy got tired of repairing it only to have the bike revert back to its unrepaired state a few minutes later, thanks to some &#8220;feature-rich&#8221; programming, so he just lets the bike fall into disrepair. Grumpy is hopeful that it will explode soon in a fiery crash so he can use a new one.</p>
<p>They rode to the first mission lair, up and down dozens of steep mountains, passing by an enraged rancor, which his buds warned him not to mess with. Actually, it was more like they ORDERED him not to mess with it, as his buds are familiar with Grumpy&#8217;s penchant for high adventure and cloning centers.</p>
<p>At the first lair, his buds and their pets did most of the clean up work, with Grumpy getting off a few rollshots from the rear flanks. One of the defilers tried to have its way with Grumpy, but thanks to Master Doctor buffs and his bud&#8217;s medic skills, Grumpy avoided a quick trip back to the North Ghetto. Grumpy was chastized for getting too close (again) to ACTUAL mobs and was told to stay back, way back, over there by the bikes!</p>
<p>When only the lair itself was left, his buds told Grumpy that he could have the lair kill all to himself, in the hopes that Grumpy might finish off Novice Pistoleer sometime in the next 2 years. Grumpy opened fire on the lair and several minutes later, one of his buds remarked that it sure was taking him a long time to finish it off. Again, pity came into play, and the pets were sent in to give Grumpy a hand. KA-CHING! An extra 6.6k in his pocket to impress the Cantina girls!</p>
<p>On the way to the last mission, Grumpy&#8217;s swoop decided it was tired and stored itself back on the datapad. This has become one of Grumpy&#8217;s favorite &#8220;features&#8221; ever since his swoop left him high and dry out in the deep Naboo wilderness. This time, however, his swoop conveniently deposited him in the middle of a camp of red and angry mobs. Grumpy burstran the rest of the way to the mission and arrived out of breath and a little banged-up from another rancor that was pleased to meet him along the way. </p>
<p>After unloading some FWG-hurt on the lair, collecting another 6.6k (ka-ching) and using his /harvest hide hotkey on anything that didn&#8217;t move, they rode their swoops back to the ghetto (this time without incident) and sat down to enjoy the afk-stylings of some Master Musician in the tavern. His buds turned over all of their hides to Grumpy, thereby ensuring that Eclipse players will have all the Sofa Chairs and Recliners they might desire for another week!</p>
<p>Grumpy enjoyed going on safari, so much so that he began to entertain thoughts of actually mastering something&#8230;anything&#8230;with his stealth alt, and NOT a master crafter clicker this time. Maybe a rich and famous Bounty Hunter, or a deadly Teras Kasi Master, or a bitter and twisted COMMANDO. Grumpy&#8217;s stealth alt could even declare allegiance to one of the warring factions&#8230;</p>
<p>Grumpy stands on the cusp of a brave, new world and he is unafraid.</p>
